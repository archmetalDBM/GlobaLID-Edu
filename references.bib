 abstract = {Samples from ore bodies, mined for copper in antiquity, can be characterized by measurements on three lead isotope ratios. Given su{\'y}cient samples, it is possible to estimate the lead isotope {\circledR}eldÐa three-dimensional constr uctÐthat characterizes the ore body. For the purposes of estimating the extent of a {\circledR}eld, or assessing whether bronze artefacts could have been made using copper from a particular {\circledR}eld, it is often assumed that {\circledR}elds have a trivariate nor mal distribution. Using recently published data, for which the sample sizes are larger than usual, this paper casts doubt on this assumption. A variety of tests of univariate nor mality are applied, both to the original lead isotope ratios and to transfor mations of them based on principal component analysis; the paper can be read as a case study in the use of tests of univariate normality for assessing multivariate normality. This is not an optimal approach, but is su{\'y}cient in the cases considered to suggest that {\circledR}elds are, in fact, `non-nor mal'. A direct test of multivariate normality con{\circledR}rms this. Some implications for the use of lead isotope ratio data in archaeology are discussed.},

They provide an effective method of data presentation for univariate and particularly bivariate data and this is illustrated with a range of examples. The methodology can be used as an informal approach to spatial cluster analysis, and one example suggests that it is competetitive with other approaches in this area. A reason for the lack of use of kernel density estimates by archaeologists may be the lack of accessible software.

 abstract = {Nearly 200 new lead isotope analyses of sulphidic and oxidized ores from 26 copper mines on Cyprus show that the mines from different geological regions group in five distinctive isotopic groups, each with a substructure, related to the geological history of the ore formation. Comparison of lead isotope compositions of Bronze Age artefacts with these data can in many cases reveal the actual mines from which the copper for particular artefacts was obtained. The particular case of the provenance of the copper for 78 Late Bronze Age copper `oxhide ingots'found in Cyprus, Crete, Greece, Sardinia, Turkey and Bulgaria is discussed. The data show that all oxhide ingots so far analysed, dating to the fourteenth century BC and later, were made of copper consistent isotopically with only one mining region in the geographical north of Cyprus, and especially the Apliki mine. The study provides further evidence which supports the validity of the conventional approach to the use of lead isotope analysis for provenancing metals; this evidence is antithetical to recent suggestions of a model for the production of copper oxhide ingots which involved widespread mixing of copper from a number of ore sources throughout the Mediterranean.},

 abstract = {linear relation is derived for the secular evolution of 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios, that permits tests to be made for open system evolution on each system independently. Application of the method to conformable ore bodies of various geological age indicates that the available data do not demand an open system evolution for the last 3.8 b.y. 238U/204Pb and 232Th/204Pb of 9.66 $\pm$ 0.15 and 37.65 $\pm$ 1.14 respectively fit best the data for this time interval.

A single stage evolution since 4.5 b.y. is unlikely, however, and the major events of continent formation postdate the Earth accretion by at least 400 m.y. The larger scatter of 207Pb/204Pb data about the evolution line relative to the other isotopic ratios is also interpreted as resulting from a series of continental differentiation events taking place at 3.85 $\pm$ 0.15 b.y.},

 abstract = {Monochrome drawn beads were widely circulated in South and Southeast Asia as early as the second century BC. This article aims to identify the glass beads unearthed from different sites in China and discuss their possible sources. Twenty-seven mineral soda alumina (m-Na-Al) glass and eighty-seven potash glass beads unearthed in different provinces in China were analysed by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The trace element analysis through Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation and Maximum Mean Discrepancy indicates the silica sources of m-Na-Al glass and most of the potash glass unearthed from Guangxi are identical. They were presumably produced somewhere in northeastern India or Southeast Asia and exported through the Maritime Silk Road. The silica sources of m-Na-Al glass in Henan and the rest of the potash glasses are geologically close. They were likely produced in southern India or Sri Lanka and exported through the North and Southwest Silk Roads. Future research on isotopic analysis will reveal more information about primary/secondary glass production in China, South and Southeast Asia.},

@article{Albarede.2020,
 abstract = {The conventional approach to ore provenance studies of ancient silver coins and artifacts has been to first analyze and then try to match them to published data about mining districts, a difficult task given our incomplete knowledge of these. While literary sources are useful to identify possible provenances, they potentially bias interpretations proper because of a variety of limitations of their time. Archeological evidence in the form of mining shafts, galleries, spoil heaps, and tools also provides a tangible and reliable record of mining, but dating such activity can be problematic and the record is inconsistent. Here we propose a new approach driven by Pb isotopic data rather than numismatic groups. Statistical analysis of Pb isotopic data is used to identify ore-defined isotopic clusters. This new method is based on an algorithm that predicts the number of isotopic clusters necessary to fulfill the simple condition that variance within isotopic clusters is minimized whereas inter-cluster variance is maximized. Since each cluster reflects a discrete geological episode within a particular environment broadly datable to a specific Pb model age, it can be identified as a potential source exploited by ancient miners. We explore the potential of this method in two examples using data from coins and ores respectively. In the first example, Roman Republican silver coins form three `end-member' clusters sourced in mining districts with Cenozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleozoic Pb model ages. The example demonstrates how sources of silver used to mint coinage of the Roman Republic shifted within 50 years of the end of the Second Punic War in 201 BCE. In the second example using Aegean galena samples, Pb isotopes distinguish components with model ages datable to the Hercynian basement, the recent Aegean tectonic province, and Cyprus, noting that significant silver mining districts may remain unidentified in either Spain or the Aegean world. We further clarify a number of potential analytical issues and advocate that users of Pb isotopes for tracing archeological artifacts measure all four lead isotopes and inspect the 12 proposed isotope combinations in order to select those that provide the best representation of the data. We also emphasize that full advantage should be taken of the geologically informed parameters (model age and Th/U/Pb relationships) to identify the geological context of metal sources.},

New lead isotope analyses of 30 leaded tin--bronze artefacts from the Wangdahu cemetery (c.500--300 BC) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, north-west China, provide the basis for the discussion. By using multivariate KDEs and the calculated likelihood of the overlap, the present work shows that the Wangdahu objects feature a unique linear array of isotope ratios, representing an important element of overall bronzes from the Arc in the first millennium BC. This characteristic isotope signature is fundamentally different from that of Dajing ores in north-east China, as well from that of early Qin bronzes in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. This suggests that a variety of metal resources were utilized by peoples living in the Arc. The KDE approach thus proves effective at presenting and comparing lead isotope data.},

@article{Albarede.2012,
 abstract = {Lead isotope ratios in ore bodies and magmatic rocks depend in a complex way on several a priori independent parameters, including the geological age of the tectonic province in which the ores and magmas formed and its U/Pb (m) and Th/U (k) ratios, two very sensitive parameters characteristic of metal sources. All these parameters are entangled in hard-toread Pb isotopic ratios. With respect to the commonly used fingerprinting techniques, which rely on the comparison of raw isotope ratios, the main motivation for the present work is to provide a method for making geologically and geochemically educated guesses about metal

provenance even in the absence of isotopic data on reference ores. It shows how to unscramble a geological model age and m and k information from isotopic measurements. This approach brings to light a new organization of the Pb isotope database and an untapped wealth of information that can be used for provenance studies and other archaeometric purposes. We provide expressions with which to calculate these parameters and, using literature data, demonstrate how Pb isotopes in ores and magmas define clear zones in the silver-rich provinces of the Central Andes. We further show how the geological model age and m and k values fingerprint production areas in 16th--18th century silver coins minted in Mexico and South America. Finally, we use Pb isotopes to illustrate how the Reconquista of the Emirate of Granada (1482--91) and the seizure of the Betic silver mines are reflected in the silver coins

of the Catholic Monarchs.},

 abstract = {Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a powerful method for elemental fingerprinting of solid samples in a quasi-nondestructive manner. In order to extend the field of application to objects outside the laboratory, a portable laser ablation sampling device was assembled using a diode pumped solid state laser and fiber-optics. The ablated materials were sampled on membrane filters and subsequently quantified by means of LA-ICPMS. The analytical performance of this approach was investigated for glass and gold reference materials. Accuracies of better than 20{\%} were reached for most elements and typical limits of detection were found to be in the range of 0.01-1 \textgreek{m}g/g. In summary, this approach combines spatially resolved sampling with the detection power of ICPMS and enables elemental fingerprinting of objects which cannot be transferred to the laboratory, e.g., archeological artifacts in museums.},

@article{Ellam.2010,
 abstract = {Lead isotope ratios are widely used to identify original sources of Pb in the environment. Such source apportionment depends on the ability to distinguish potential sources on the basis of their isotopic composition. However, almost all terrestrial Pb is co-linear in some of the plots i.e. (206)Pb/(208)Pb versus (206)Pb/(207)Pb and (206)Pb/(204)Pb versus (206)Pb/(207)Pb commonly presented in the literature. These diagrams are unable to distinguish more than two sources of environmental Pb. Linear trends in such plots are an inevitable consequence of the co-linearity of terrestrial leads and should not be taken necessarily to indicate simple binary mixing of sources. A more reliable test for multiple source mixing can be obtained from plots involving (206)Pb/(204)Pb, (207)Pb/(204)Pb and (208)Pb/(204)Pb and therefore requires measurements of the minor (204)Pb isotope.},

@article{Cannon.1961,
 abstract = {Searching questions about the origins of ore deposits have been asked for many years. Where do ore fluids originate - within the crust, or deeper? Can specific sources of ore metals be identified? When were ores deposited? How long did mineralization continue? What was the rate and paragenesis of deposition? Which deposits are cogenetic, and what metallogenetic provinces do they define? Isotope analyses of Pb from rocks and ores provide a new tool for attacking such problems of ore genesis. About 2,000 such analyses now available from more than 20 laboratories have been compiled and studied for this purpose. The data now available suggest partial answers to some questions and serve to define other, new problems, not previously recognized. Their greatest import, however, is to illustrate the potential future significance of Pb-isotope studies. Ore-Pb, as shown 2 decades ago, ranges widely in isotopic composition. Recent studies show that traces of Pb in ordinary rocks of the earth's crust exhibit apparently similar variations. All these variations are attributable primarily to mixing of old Pb with accumulations of new radiogenic Pb from decay of radioactive U and Th. Each sample of Pb preserves in its isotopic composition a record of its own mixing history: a composite record of the time this Pb was in different environments, its past associations with U and Th, and the geochemical processes that moved it from place to place. Integrated study of all these variables will throw light on many difficult problems of ore genesis when adequate techniques are developed. Progress will be slow, however, until more accurate Pb-isotope analyses can be made at lower cost and more objective criteria developed for interpreting measured isotopic compositions in terms of geologic history.},

@article{Taylor.,
 abstract = {Analytical precision for Pb isotope measurement by thermal and plasma source mass spectrometry has improved by an order of magnitude in the last 20 years. Much of this improvement relates to a shift away from the external method of correcting instrumental mass fractionation -- where samples are assumed to fractionate to the same extent as an average value of a working measurement standard. Implementation of a variety of techniques, including thallium spiking, sample--standard bracketing and double/triple spiking has provided more robust methods of fractionation correction. Isotope laboratories use one or more of these procedures, but an assessment of the measurement precision and relative merits of each system is needed to determine which is the most appropriate for the purpose. This study reviews each of these methods and provides a comparison based on an extensive analytical record covering 18 years, and using a variety of mass spectrometers. As two or three of the methods have been applied to most measurements, direct and robust comparisons can be made between correction protocols. In particular the effects of sample purity and variable sample matrices on measurement precision and accuracy have been examined. Data acquired from the measurement of rock, soil and metal are used to provide a statistical comparison of the analytical uncertainty of each technique, guiding the choice of the most appropriate method. Isotope standard data acquired over this period is also compared with other high-precision laboratories to generate a set of concordant working ratios for the NIST SRM 981 Pb standard: 206Pb/204Pb = 16.9412; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.4988; 208Pb/204Pb = 36.7233.},
