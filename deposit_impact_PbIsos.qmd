## Learning objective
In this unit you will learn about the Pb-Isotope specific aspects of ores.

## Prior knowledge
... building upon what you already know ... 

* formation of ore deposits
* lead isotope systematics
* partitioning of elements

## Material
... by doing these things: 

Interactive figure: typical minerals in ore deposits, one for Pb/Ag, one for Cu

Animation: large-scale effects such as multiple generations, hydrothermal overprinting (deposit + Pb-Isotope diagram)

Graphical quiz to emphasize bulk vs. in-situ analysis: shooting with LA on multiple generations in ore, coupled with Pb isotope diagram, button for bulk


## Learning content

* Important minerals, e.g. separation of U and Pb, differences between Cu, Pb
* Problems (multiple generations, reactivation) 

### Minerals in copper ore deposits

Deposits interact with their environment, leading to an alteration of the ore minerals. Have a look on the figure below to learn more about which copper ore minerals occur in which zone of an ore deposit.

* Fluctuations in the depth of the ground water table will obscure the start and end of the zones.
* Geologic uplift of the deposit can result in the creation of multiple supergene enrichment zones.
