    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome\nThis interactive textbook is part of GlobaLID, the Global Lead Isotope Database. GlobaLID aims to modernise the handling of lead isotope data in archaeological research by providing an modern infrastructure for handling, storing and accessing these data. While working on this infrastructure, it became quickly obvious that beside the infrastructural aspects, a large demand on training in the lead isotope method exists, too. As a result, the idea of this interactive textbook was born.\nThis textbook aims to provide a holistic approach on how lead isotope data are obtained, used and interpret in archaeological research by combining aspects from geoscience, archaeology, and data science. The target group are all persons with a general background in science and basic knowledge in geosciences and preferably archaeology.\nThe content of this book mixes text with a wide range of media, such as videos, interactive content, serious games and small embedded application. The guiding principles for work on this book are to make its content available and as accessible as possible without requiring specialised infrastructure, including a collection of print templates and other resources that you will hopefully find useful for, e.g., everyday work in the lab.\nThis textbook is still work in progress with additional chapters being added over time. We are welcoming any kind of contribution and feedback from our readers and the experts in the field. The current outline of the book is already presented to show what is yet to come and where we would be particularly happy about contributions by the community. If you want to contribute, please contact the editor or fork the associated Github repository and create a push request with your materials.",

    "section": "3.4 Learning content",
    "text": "3.4 Learning content\nPb has four long-time stable isotopes - 208Pb (52.4 %), 207Pb (22.1 %), and 206Pb (24.1 %), which are continuously produced by radiogenic decay of 232Th, 235U and 238U, respectively. 204Pb (1.4 %) is primordial and its abundance therefore is constant. Other naturally occurring isotopes of Pb are short-lived; for example 210Pb only has a half-life of 22.3 years. The abundances of 208Pb, 207Pb, and 206Pb vary as a function of the U–Th–Pb contents of the parental source(s) and the system closure time. By relating the radiogenic isotopes to the primordial 204Pb, these relationships can be deduced and are described by the following equations:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{^{206}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{^{206}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right)_0 + \\left(\\frac{^{238}U}{^{204}Pb}\\right) \\cdot \\left(e^{\\lambda_{238} \\cdot t}-1\\right)\\]\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{^{207}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{^{207}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right)_0 + \\left(\\frac{^{235}U}{^{204}Pb}\\right) \\cdot \\left(e^{\\lambda_{235} \\cdot t}-1\\right)\\]\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{^{208}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{^{208}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right)_0 + \\left(\\frac{^{232}Th}{^{204}Pb}\\right) \\cdot \\left(e^{\\lambda_{232} \\cdot t}-1\\right)\\]\nThe subscript \\(_0\\) denotes the initial Pb at the start of the model \\(t\\). It is the ratio of the isotopic composition of Pb when the system closed (e.g., crystallisation of a mineral). Isotope ratios without subscripts denote the measured lead isotope composition, i.e. today’s ratios (\\(t=0\\)). The decay constants of 238U, 235U and 232Th are:\n\\[λ_{238}=4.468\\cdot10^9\\ a\\]\n\\[λ_{235}=0.704\\cdot10^9\\ a\\]\n\\[λ_{232}=14.1\\cdot10^9\\ a\\]\nTherefore, different geological environments (e.g., mantle, crust) and tectonic processes result in distinct Pb isotope ratios. These relationships often are assessed on the basis of model parameters – the model age, µ (235U/204Pb) and κ (232Th/235U) – which are calculated from the 204Pb-based isotope ratios. Different models have been developed, of which the most widely used are the two-stage models of Stacey and Kramers (1975) and Albarède and Juteau (1984).\nPb isotope ratios are applied in ore deposit geology to reconstruct the metal sources and formation processes of ore mineralisations. Grögler et al. (1966) and Brill and Wampler (1967) first analysed Pb isotope ratios of archaeological metal objects to determine from which ore deposits the raw material might have potentially been sourced. The direct comparison between the isotope signatures of archaeological objects and ore mineralisations is possible since the effect of pyrometallurgical and weathering processes on Pb isotope ratios is typically negligible. Nowadays, Pb isotopes are therefore a key method for assessing the potential raw material provenance of various Pb-bearing archaeological materials such as metals and alloys, glass, glazes, pigments and ceramics.",

For example, analysing a copper-based metal with 0.1 wt.% and 90 wt.% Cu for its Pb isotope composition will require a larger sample size than an analysis of its copper isotope composition.\nWe recommend placing a sampling label with the sampled object. Sampling labels specify the sampling method, purpose of the study and provide details about the sampling person and institution. Exemplary sampling labels are available in the appendix, which you can fill out with your information, date of sampling, and where you can add logos of your institution and, if applicable, funding organisation, in the blank space at the bottom.\n\n\n4.4.2 Sample dissolution\nAn important prerequisite for work in the laboratory is properly cleaned labware. Otherwise, the Pb isotope signal might be contaminated by remnants from previous samples or other sources such as atmospheric Pb. Examples for cleaning procedures for different types of labware are provided in the appendix. Moreover, all steps are usually carried out in a clean room to avoid contamination of the samples by dust and atmospheric Pb.\nDissolving a sample completely is often necessary to measure the average chemical or isotopic composition of a sample. It removes any heterogeneity within the sample and at the same time transforms the sample into a liquid. The dissolved sample can be easily adjusted in, e.g., its concentration and therefore can be analysed with a wide range of instruments to measure its chemical composition. Dissolving the sample also allows to separate in the next step (Section 4.4.3) the targeted element for isotope analysis, such as Pb.\nDifferent acids are used to dissolve a sample, often in combination. Probably most famous is aqua regia, a mixture of concentrated HCl and HNO3 in the ratio of 3:1, which dissolves Au. The combination of different acids is often necessary because samples cannot be dissolved completely with only one acid. For example, HCl is very efficient in dissolving carbonates but not organic material, while HNO3 readily dissolves organic material but not carbonates.\nAcid digestion is a standard procedure for dissolving samples and well-established protocols exist, which can deviate between laboratories in their details. The samples are usually heated to accelerate the dissolution reaction. You can learn more about which exemplary acid combinations are used for which samples in the following game.\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Pb separation\nIf Pb is not the main element in your sample, you must separate it from all other elements (e.g., Cu, Ag), now that your sample is completely dissolved. Otherwise, a reliable measurement of its isotopic composition won’t be possible.\nFor the separation of Pb we use a technique called ion-exchange chromatography (IEC). In a nutshell, an organic polymer (resin) is treated (conditioned) with different acids of variable concentrations. Depending on the acid and its concentration, the resin binds ions of some elements more efficiently than others. This behaviour can be utilised to separate elements from each other by treating the resin with suitably concentrated acids in a useful order. When put into a column, gravity lets the acids flow through the resin, allowing collection of the different fractions (eluates) by changing beakers.\nIEC is a very efficient method because the resin can principally be re-used multiple times. However, it is often also a time-consuming method. The video below is a time-lapse for the Pb separation protocol, which in real time took about 4 hours per sample. However, multiple samples can be handled in parallel. By experience, 10 to 15 samples are a good compromise between efficiency and quality.\n\nThe time-lapse features a standard protocol for Pb separation. It uses the resin AG1x8. For archaeometallurgical samples (e.g. slag, metals, metal alloys), only Pb binds to this resin when treated with 0.6 M HBr. When treated with 6 M HCl, Pb and the other elements are not retained by the resin and washed out completely. You might have noticed the strong colour change of the resin caused by the Cu in the sample and how quickly it was washed out again. And that beakers were changed in between to separately collect the matrix and Pb. The matrix is usually discarded if no other analyses are planned for this sample. However, if further analyses are planned, the matrix will be kept and treated further for these additional analyses.\nUsing this information, you can now reconstruct the IEC protocol shown in the video.\n\n\nYou can also find print templates for this protocol in the appendix. Milot et al. (2021) present another protocol for the separation of lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparation of Pb from Au- and Ag-rich samples\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparation of Pb from Au-Ag-rich samples requires a modified two-step protocol for IEC due to reaction of Ag with HCl (precipitation of AgCl) and of Au with HBr. The protocol was developed by Bendall (2003) and tested and slightly modified by Standish et al. (2013). It comprises the following main steps:\n\nDigestion of the sample in aqua regia, precipitated AgCl is separated by decanting the solution after centrifuging. The liquid is evaporated and re-dissolved in HCl.\nFirst column separation: Removal of Au by elution with HCl (Au is fixated on the resin). The liquid is evaporated and re-dissolved in HBr. When handling particularly Ag-rich samples, remaining Ag will precipitate as AgCl when evaporating the eluted liquid. In this case, the sample should be taken up in 7M HNO3 and the insoluble AgCl removed by decanting the solution after centrifuging. The liquid subsequently is evaporated and taken up with HBr.\nSecond column separation: Removal of the remaining Cu-rich matrix with HBr or a HBr-HNO3 mixture Standish et al. (2013) and elution of Pb with HCl. This last step is equivalent to the classic Pb separation protocol.\n\nPrecipitation of AgCl during digestion and IEC has the potential to fractionate Pb. Tests of the slightly modified protocol by Standish et al. (2013) showed a Pb yield of c. 95% with a maximum deviation of ±502 ppm for the 206Pb/204Pb ratio. Jansen (2019) used the protocol from Bendall (2003) and found no significant fractionation of Pb isotope values within the 2σ standard errors of the analyses. Users should keep in mind that fractionation effects might become relevant (i.e. measurable) with increasing instrumental sensitivity.\nA print template for this protocol is included in the appendix.",

These instruments measure the ratios of masses (m) to electrical charge (z) of ionised sample components. Different types of mass spectrometers exist but they all consist of four major consecutive units:\n\nSample introduction system: Introduces the sample in a suitable state as required by the type of mass spectrometer used.\nIon source: The sample is vaporised, ionised, focused and transported/accelerated.\nAnalyser: The ions are sorted electrically and/or magnetically according to their m/z ratio.\nDetector: The separated ions (isotopes) are detected.\n\nDepending on the constellation of the four units, different types of mass spectrometers are distinguished.\n\n\n5.4.2 Instrumentation\nNowadays, most laboratories use multi-collector mass spectrometers with inductively coupled plasma (MC-ICP-MS) for the analysis of Pb isotope ratios. They provide reliable and fast analysis by simultaneous detection of isotopes and therefore greatly reduce measurement errors caused by internal instability of the instrument. The following video provides a brief introduction of the principal components and functions.\n\nQuadrupole-ICP-MS instruments use an electric quadrupole consisting of four metal rods. Only ions with a specific mass-to-charge ratio can pass through the quadrupole. By varying the parameters of these electric fields, the ion beam can be filtered and different masses are successively detected. Due to its lower resolution, quadrupole ICP-MS instruments cannot reliably precisely determine isotope ratios but are routinely applied for compositional trace element analysis. Single-collector detection systems also are prone to instrumental instabilities (due to the time passed during analysis of the elemental masses), resulting in comparatively high analytical errors and a lower sensitivity which is insufficient for isotopic measurements but well suitable for trace element analysis.\nThermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) was the predominantly used instrument prior to the advent of MC-ICP-MS in the 2000s. For this technique, a chemically purified solid sample is loaded on one to three filaments (a thin metal strip). The filaments are heated to vaporise the sample for introduction into the instrument. Isotopic fractionation can be very well controlled with TIMS since it is exclusively caused by well-known thermal fractionation effects. Therefore, isotopic ratios can be very precisely determined with this technique. However, TIMS requires an elaborate sample preparation prior to analysis and measurements cannot be fully automatised since the heating voltage has to be manually adjusted for every sample deposited on the filaments. Furthermore, Pb is difficult to efficiently ionise thermally due to its high mass. Therefore, MC-ICP-MS has largely superseded TIMS for Pb isotope analysis.\nthey key characteristics of the different instrument types and their most common use cases for inorganic materials are

figure below, the photos show, if not otherwise mentioned, components of a ThermoScientific NeptunePlus MC-ICP-MS instrument hosted at the Frankfurt Isotope and Element Research Center (FIERCE) of the Goethe University Frankfurt. The sample introduction system shown in the photos is adjusted for handling liquid sample solutions but other configurations exist. The NeptunePlus is a double-focusing magnetic sector instrument. That means, it consists of two analyzers – an electromagnet and an electrostatic analyzer, which are combined in a specific geometric constellation and whose order can be different in the setup of specific instruments.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Ensuring high quality measurements of Pb isotopes\nA major shortcoming of MC-ICP-MS in comparison to TIMS is the inherent instability of the plasma source which renders instrumental isotopic fractionation difficult to predict. This fractionation effect can be assessed by analysing the isotopic composition of an element which behaves similar to the target element; in case of Pb, thallium (Tl) is used due to the similar masses of its two isotopes (205Tl and 203Tl). In practice, a known amount of Tl elemental or isotopic (NIST SRM 997) standard is added to the measurement solution (“spiking”) and 205Tl and 203Tl are analysed alongside the Pb isotopes. Fractionation is generally assumed to follow an exponential law and fractionation factors are calculated based on the natural 205Tl/203Tl ratio. Since the 2000s, several different 205Tl/203Tl ratios have been used in analytical studies which often have been determined by empirical adjustment during the measurement sessions (e.g., Rehkämper and Mezger 2000; White et al. 2000; Collerson et al. 2002; Thirlwall 2002; Taylor et al. 2015; Yuan et al. 2016). Apart from the two Tl isotopes, the masses 204Hg and 202Hg are typically analysed together with the four stable Pb isotopes to account for isobaric interferences potentially affecting 204Pb.\nThe certified Pb isotope reference material NIST SRM 981 is routinely analysed throughout the measurement sessions. The purpose is to further compensate for instrumental instabilities by normalising sample analyses “bracketed” by standard analyses to the fixed values of the standard. Furthermore, analysis of a material with known isotopic composition allows to consistently monitor the precision and accuracy of the measurements. Several different values have been determined for the NIST SRM 981; an overview is provided by Yuan et al. (2016).",

    "text": "20.4 Learning content\nBecause lead isotopes are represented by three independent ratios, e.g., 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb, they can be visualised in a three dimensional geometric space. However, often only two dimensions can be represented in one plot. In addition, different ways of optically grouping and highlighting groups within the Pb isotope space exist. Published real archaeological datasets will be used as examples to demonstrate how these data can be treated in different ways. They are available in the GitHub repository of this book. It is important to keep in mind that every plot has its pros and cons and there is no general consensus which is the best presentation.\nAll plots were created in R with support of different packages. The respective scripts are embedded in the unrendered version of this chapter.\n\n\n20.4.1 Binary scatter plot\nThe bi-plot (Figure 20.1) is by far the most common option to display lead isotope data. Since there are four isotopes of Pb, twelve combinations of isotopic ratios can be derived. The use of paired ratios depends on the instruments used and the scientific disciplines of the studies. In the early days, Pb isotopic ratios were often reported based on 206Pb-based ratios as 204Pb could not be measured precisely. However, in the 2000s, the advent of the multi-collector mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) and the double- or triple-spiked technique created a huge amount of Pb isotope data with precisely measured 204Pb. Conventionally, environmental science tends to use the ratios based on 206Pb, which however generates plots with linear patterns and thus a low discrimination power (Ellam 2010). In geological literature, ratios based on 204Pb are commonplace which enable a better visualisation of system closure time (or model age) and U-Th-Pb composition (or µ and κ) of parental source(s) (Albarède et al. 2012). However, it has to be kept in mind that all two-dimensional plots incompletely represent a dataset. All twelve combination plots are suggested to be tested to view the full isotopic extent of ore deposits (Albarede et al. 2020). Ideally, the Pb isotopic ratios should be considered in a three-dimensional space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.1: A binary plot of Roman lead artefacts in comparison with ore districts in Germany.\n\n\n\n\n20.4.2 Bi-plot using geological-informed parameters\nInstead of isotopic ratios, Albarède et al. (2012) advocate the use of calculated geological model parameters, namely the model age (T), U/Pb (μ), and Th/U (κ) to discriminate potential ore sources in provenance studies (Figure 20.2). As shown in chapter 3, 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb are generated by radioactive decay of their parental isotopes 238U, 235U, and 232Th, respectively. We can therefore calculate the model age, 238U/204Pb and 232Th/238U from the Pb isotope ratios determined for a given sample using the equations provided in Albarède et al. (2012) or any other of the Pb isotope models mentioned in chapter 3 by using, e.g., an R script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: A binary plot of Roman lead artefacts using geological parameters of model age (T), U/Pb (μ), and Th/U (κ).\n\n\n\n\n20.4.3 Bi-plot with 90% confidence ellipse\nThe increasing amount of available Pb isotope analyses resulted in the issue of how to effectively present overlapping data. One way to circumvent this problem is the creation of so-called “ore fields” that represent the extent of Pb isotopic variation given that the data follow a normal distribution. Some researchers have resorted to the 90% confidence ellipse (Figure 20.3) as the reference for ore sourcing (Stos-Gale et al. 1997). This technique was severely criticised by Baxter and Gale (1998), who demonstrated the non-normality of Pb isotope data in a number of instances. The 90% confidence ellipse is no longer considered suitable for representing an ore Pb isotopic population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Ellipses based on 206Pb vs 207Pb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Ellipses based on 206Pb vs 208Pb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3: Binary scatter plots with 90% confidence ellipses around data points.\n\n\n\n20.4.4 Binary plot with the kernel density estimation\nDue to the non-normality of Pb isotope data, both Baxter et al. (1997) and Scaife et al. (1999) advocated the use of more robust kernel density estimates (KDEs) to display the isotopic extent of orefields (Figure 20.4). KDEs are a non-parametric method to transform continuous data into a smoothed probability density function. KDEs offer three main advantages:\n\nThey do not assume the normality of data;\nThey can produce smoother distributions than conventional histograms, whose appearance is significantly affected by the choices of bin width and the start/end points of bins; and\nThey can represent data in a multidimensional space and enable users to effectively compare different datasets either graphically or mathematically.\n\nGiven these advantages, the KDE method has become popular in recent publications of archaeological sciences (Hsu et al. 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) KDEs based on 206Pb vs 207Pb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) KDEs based on 206Pb vs 208Pb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: Binary plots with the KDEs of mining regions. Note that three different color gradients from light to dark represent respective intervals of 95%, 75%, and 50%.\n\n\n\n20.4.5 Ternary diagram\nThis plotting method was first utilised by Cannon et al. (1961) who aimed to understand the principles of isotopic variations in ore lead. Raw isotopic ratios were expressed as relative abundances of 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb summed up to 100% by leaving out 204Pb. The transformed data were plotted as trilinear coordinates. The choice of represented masses was justified by the incapability of precisely determining the amount of 204Pb due to its low natural abundance of only 1.4% (uncertainties ~2.5%). These ternary diagrams were proposed as a solution to overcome the problem of analytically fundamentally biased data. However, they were rendered irrelevant with the advent of improved analytical techniques and the development of error correction models, which greatly increased precision (Taylor et al. 2015). A good example of using ternary diagrams is provided in (Hsu and Sabatini 2019).\nThe raw isotopic ratios are mathematically converted to three individual Pb compositions using the following equations:\n\\[\n^{206}Pb = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{^{206}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) \\cdot 100}{\\left(\\frac{^{206}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{^{207}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{^{208}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\n^{207}Pb = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{^{207}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) \\cdot 100}{\\left(\\frac{^{206}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{^{207}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{^{208}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\n^{208}Pb = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{^{208}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) \\cdot 100}{\\left(\\frac{^{206}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{^{207}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{^{208}Pb}{^{204}Pb}\\right)}\n\\] Figure 20.5 displays a ternary scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.5: A ternary plot of lead isotope data visualising the same dataset.\n\n\n\n\n20.4.6 Ternary diagram with the kernel density estimation\nKDE contour plots like in Figure 20.4 can also be generated for ternary diagrams (Figure 20.6). This helps us to better visualise the isotopic distribution of ore populations when many data are presented. However, the ternary KDE, in a sense, is not equal to the three-dimensional KDE. It is rather a regular KDE that is truncated to the ternary triangle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.6: Ternary plot with the KDEs of mining regions. Note that the contours in the KDEs represent different intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n20.4.7 Three-dimensional plot\nThe use of any single bivariate plot is insufficient for provenancing and is visually confusing when the ratios overlap. Therefore, additional diagrams are needed to show other combinations of isotopes. Three-dimensional plots represent the distribution of data in a three dimensional space (Figure 20.7) which has a higher discrimination power and is therefore better suited for provenance studies. The downside is that it is inherently difficult to read a 3D diagram and, therefore, a rotatable version is highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.7: The same dataset visualised as a three-dimensional plot.\n\n\n\n\n20.4.8 Three-dimensional plot with kernel density estimation\nThis plotting method applies kernel density estimation to a three-dimensional diagram (Figure 20.8). It can help to delineate reference datasets with which targeted artefacts can be compared. Beardah and Baxter (1999) pioneered the application of a three-dimensional kernel plot in Pb isotope studies and suggested a sample size of 20 as an acceptable value. However, they also realised that larger sample sizes, ranging from 40 to 60, would be necessary if the population from which the sample is drawn is not normally distributed. To construct the 3D kernel plot using R, we modified the code from Ma et al. (2022).\n\n\nWarning: no DISPLAY variable so Tk is not available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.8: Three-dimensional plot with the KDEs of the mining regions.",
