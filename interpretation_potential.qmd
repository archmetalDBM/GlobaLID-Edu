## Learning objective
In this unit you will learn the potential of lead isotopes in archaeological research.

## Prior knowledge
... building upon what you already know ... 

* Geochemical understanding
* Ore geology
* Visualisation of lead isotopes


## Material
... by doing these things: 

Expert interviews (D. Wigg-Wolf, other archaeologists)


## Learning content
Limitations and application of lead isotopes in archaeological research


## Self check
Now you can provide answers to the following questions: 

* ...
